## Motivation
The motivation for this post materialized while reading the New York Times Bestseller "The Man Who Solved The Market" by Gregory Zuckerman. Recently I have become fascinated in the investment process taken by Renaissance Technology and their resulting returns. Over the past 30 years the firm, under the leadership of James Simons has averaged 71.8% returns from 1994 through 2014 in their flagship Medallion Fund. Unfortunately for any allocator, the fund has been capped at 10 Billion USD and closed to outside investors since 1994.
